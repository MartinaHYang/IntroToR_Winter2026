    "text": "1. R vs. RStudio: The Engine and the Dashboard\nIt is common to get these confused, but they are separate entities:\n\nR (The Engine): The programming language that does the actual math. It was developed at the University of Auckland.\n\nIt is the powerful machine under the hood. It does all the heavy lifting, makes the car move, and handles the energy. But on its own, an engine is just a block of metal on the floor—you can’t sit in it or steer it easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio (The Dashboard): An Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is the software interface (developed by Posit) that makes writing R code much easier.\n\nIt’s the steering wheel, the seats, the GPS, and the speedometer. It’s the beautiful interface that lets you interact with the engine so you can actually drive where you want to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: Each program must be downloaded separately. You need to install both programs on your computer, but you will only ever “open” RStudio to do your work.",

    "text": "2. File Types: Scripts vs. Notebooks\nIn R, there are several ways to save your work. Choosing the right file type depends on whether you are writing code for a “computer” to run or a “human” to read.\n\n2.1 R Scripts (.R)\nThink of an R Script like a plain text file for code.\n\nBest for: Automation, data cleaning pipelines, and long-term “heavy lifting.”\nPros: Very fast and lightweight. It is the “gold standard” for portability because it doesn’t require any special software other than R itself to run.\nCons: Not great for storytelling; you can add comments (using #), but you can’t include formatted text, headers, or images easily.\n\n\n\n2.2 Notebooks (.Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb)\nNotebooks follow the “Literate Programming” philosophy, where your code, its output (plots/tables), and your narrative text live together in one document.\n\nR Markdown (.Rmd): The classic notebook for R. It has been the industry standard for years for creating PDFs and Word reports.\nQuarto (.qmd): The modern “successor” to R Markdown. It is more powerful and supports multiple languages (R, Python, Julia). This entire website was built using Quarto!\nJupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Most common in the Python community, but can be used for R. Great for interactive data exploration but harder to use for writing a full thesis or book.\n\n\n\n2.3 Comparison at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Type\nExtension\nPrimary Use Case\nBest Analogy\n\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nPure code.

    "text": "3. How to interact with RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWelcome to your new workspace!\nIs this your first time opening RStudio? The interface can feel overwhelming at first with its four different panes. Don’t worry—each one has a specific purpose designed to keep your research organized.\n\n\n\n3.1 Overview\nAs shown in the figure below, the RStudio interface is divided into four primary panes. By default, they are arranged and named as follows:\n\nSource Editor (Top-Left): Where you write and save your code.\nConsole (Bottom-Left): Where R executes your commands and shows immediate results.\nEnvironment & History (Top-Right): Where your active data and past commands are stored.\nFiles, Plots, & Help (Bottom-Right): Your utility pane for navigating files, viewing graphs, and reading documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat to do if a pane is missing\n\n\n\nIf your screen doesn’t look like the default layout, or if one of the panes has disappeared:\n\nGo to the top menu and select View &gt; Panes &gt; Show All Panes.\nYou can further customize the layout and appearance under this same menu to suit your personal preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe “Disappearing” Source Pane\n\n\n\nA common question from beginners is: “Why do I only see three windows?” If the Source Editor (the top-left window) is missing, it is usually because you haven’t opened a file yet. To make it appear, you simply need to create a new script:\n\nVia Menu: Select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nVia Keyboard Shortcut: \n\nPC: Ctrl + Shift + N\nMac: Cmd + Shift + N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 The Source Editor (Top-Left)\nThis is your primary workspace. Think of it as a specialized “Text Editor” for your research files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Function Overview\nYou use this pane to write, edit, and save your scripts. Unlike the Console, everything you type here can be saved for future use.\n\n\n3.2.2 Compatibility\nRStudio can open almost any text-based file, including:\n\nData Scripts: R (.R), Python (.py), or SQL.\nNotebooks: Quarto (.qmd) and R Markdown (.Rmd).\nDocuments: Plain text (.txt), LaTeX (.tex), and BibTeX (.bib).\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Data Viewer\nYou can also use this pane to inspect datasets in a “read-only” spreadsheet format (similar to Excel).\n\n\n3.2.4 Executing Code\nTo run code from the Source Editor, you don’t just hit “Enter.” Instead, you use a specific keyboard shortcut to “send” the code from your script down to the Console:\n\nMac: Cmd + Return (or Enter)\nWindows/Linux: Ctrl + Enter\nNote: If you hit Enter by itself in the Source Editor, it will simply create a new line—just like in a Word document. It will not run your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWays to Run Your Code\n\n\n\n\nRun a Single Line: Place your cursor anywhere on the line you want to execute and use the shortcut.\nRun a Section: Highlight a block of code with your mouse and then use the shortcut to run the entire selection at once.\nThe “Run” Button: You can also highlight your code and click the Run button in the top-right corner of the Source Pane. However, most professional R users prefer the keyboard shortcuts as they are much faster and more efficient!\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Limitation\nYou cannot open Microsoft Office documents (.docx, .xlsx) or image files directly here—those must be imported using code.\n\n\n\n3.3 The Console (Bottom-Left)\nThe Console is the “Engine Room.” This is where R actually executes your commands and displays the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting Code: You can type code directly into the Console and hit Enter/Return to see the result immediately.\n\nThe Drawback: You cannot easily edit a command once it has been run. While you can use the Up Arrow key to retrieve your previous lines, these commands are not saved to your file.\nBest Practice: Always write your code in a Script (Source Pane) first, then “send” it to the Console to run. This ensures your work is reproducible.\nIt is worth emphasizing again: Code typed directly into the Console is not saved. If you want to keep your work, always write your code in the Source Editor and “send” it to the Console to run.\nHow to rescue “lost” code: If you accidentally ran a long line of code in the Console and realized you forgot to save it to your script, don’t worry! You can find it in the History tab (Top-Right pane).\n\nThe History tab shows every command you have executed in order.\nIt does not show the results or outputs (like plots or tables), only the text of the commands.\nYou can select a line in the History tab and click “To Source” to send it back to your permanent script.\n\n\nThe Broom Icon: Use the broom icon (top-right of the pane) or the shortcut Ctrl + L to clear the text if the window becomes cluttered. This does not delete your data; it just cleans your screen.\n\nNote: This only clears the “text” on the screen; it does not delete your data or variables.\n\nChecking Your R Version: The top of the Console displays your current R version (e.g., R 4.4.1). If a package fails to install, check here first to see if you need to update R.\n\nNote that updating RStudio (the software) does not automatically update R (the language engine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding Your Working Directory: Right next to your R version, you will see a file path starting with ~/. This is your Working Directory—the specific folder on your computer where R is currently “looking” for files.\n\nUnderstanding how R finds files is essential to avoiding the common \"File not found\" error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\nAbsolute Path\nThe full “GPS address” from your C: drive or User folder.\nC:/Users/Martina/Project/data/raw_counts.csv\n\n\nRelative Path\nA “shorthand” address starting from your current folder.\nIn that case, your Working Directory must be set to: C:/Users/Martina/Project/\ndata/raw_counts.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBest Practice: We recommend putting your relative data and your R script in the same folder (or a sub-folder) and using Relative Paths. This makes your project “portable”—if you send the whole folder to a colleague, the code will still work on their computer!\n\n\n\n\n3.4 The Environment & History (Top-Right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment: This tab shows you every “object” (datasets, variables, results) currently stored in R’s memory. If a variable isn’t listed here, R doesn’t know it exists!\n\nThe “Golden Rule”: If a variable or dataset isn’t listed here, R does not know it exists! If you get an error saying Object not found, check this tab first to see if you successfully created or imported it.\n\nHistory: This tracks every single line of code you have run in the current session. If you forgot to save a line of code to your script, you can find it here.\nKey Features & Icons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave/Load Workspace (Disk Icons): These allow you to save your entire Environment as an .RData file. This is a huge time-saver for large projects; instead of re-running hours of code to recreate your variables, you can simply “Load” the .RData file and pick up exactly where you left off.\nImport Dataset Button: This is a “user-friendly” wizard that helps you import Excel, CSV, or SPSS files without typing out the code yourself. It’s a great “shortcut” for beginners—RStudio will even show you the code it generated so you can learn for next time.\nMemory Usage (Pie Chart): This shows how much of your computer’s RAM is being used by R. If this number is extremely high, your computer may slow down or “lag.” This is common when working with massive genomic datasets or the UK Biobank.\nThe Broom Icon (Clear Environment): Clicking the broom will delete everything in your current Environment. Use this with caution! It is useful for a “fresh start,” but it cannot be undone.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Files, Plots, & Help (Bottom-Right)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your “Utility” pane:\n\nFiles: A basic file explorer to navigate your computer.\nPlots: Where your visualizations (like GTT curves) will appear once you run your code.\nHelp: The most useful tab for beginners!\n\nThe Search Bar: You can type the name of any function (e.g., ggplot) or package (e.g., dplyr) directly into the search bar at the top of the Help pane.\nThe Console Shortcut: A faster way used by most R users is to type a question mark ? followed by the function name in the Console and hit Enter:\n\n?mean   # This opens the help page for the mean function\n?sd     # This opens the help page for standard deviation\n\nWhat to look for: R documentation can be dense, but you should always scroll to the very bottom to find the Examples section. You can copy and paste these examples directly into your console to see how the function works in action.",

    "text": "1. Why Not Excel?\nExcel is a fantastic tool for initial data entry and simple calculations. However, for professional scientific research, it has significant limitations that can compromise your results.\n\nThe Limitations of Spreadsheets\n\nInflexible with Large Data: Large datasets (like genomic data) often cause Excel to lag or crash. Searching a 100MB spreadsheet can take minutes in Excel.\n\nIn R, the same search takes milliseconds. R is designed to handle millions of rows efficiently and uses optimized data compression to keep your workflow fast.\n\nAutomatic “Auto-Correct” Errors: Excel is famous for “helpfully” converting gene names like MARCH1 into dates (e.g., 01-March-2025). This has historically corrupted thousands of published papers.\n\nIn R, your data is treated as pure text by default. R won’t change your data unless you explicitly tell it to.\nNote: The only common “auto-change” in R is the word NA, which R reserves for “Not Available” (missing data)—we will discuss this later.\n\nPoor Reproducibility: In Excel, if you accidentally delete a cell or change a value, there is no “audit trail.” You might never notice the mistake.\n\nIn R, every change is documented in your code. You can add comments to explain why you made a change, allowing you (and your collaborators) to follow your logic months later.\n\nVersion Incompatibility: We have all experienced an Excel file that looks perfect on a Mac but appears broken or “skewed” when opened on Windows or in different software like Numbers or WPS.\n\nR is a pure programming language, meaning your code will run exactly the same way regardless of the operating system.\n\nThe “Copy-Paste” Risk: Many students store data in Excel but copy-paste it into software like GraphPad Prism or SPSS for analysis. This manual step is a major source of human error. It’s easy to lose track of which version of the data you copied.\n\nIn R, you import your data directly via code. This creates a clear, permanent link between your raw data and your final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMy Personal Recommendation\n\n\n\nExcel remains the most user-friendly interface for manual data entry and “beautifying” simple tables for quick viewing.\nI personally recommend a hybrid workflow:\n\nUse Excel (specifically saving as .csv files rather than .xlsx, just my personal preference) for initial data storage.\nUse R for all subsequent data cleaning, statistical analysis, and publication-quality visualization.",

    "section": "2. What is R?",
    "text": "2. What is R?\nR is more than just a tool; it is a Statistical Programming Language designed by scientists, for scientists. It is an integrated suite for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical display.\n\nThe “Free” in Free Software\nIn the world of coding, we often say R is “Free as in Speech, not just free as in beer.” This means it isn’t just about the cost ($0); it is about the freedom to use and share it.\nThis philosophy gives you four fundamental freedoms:\n\nUnlimited Use: You can run the program for any purpose (academic, commercial, or personal) without expensive licenses.\nFull Transparency: You can study how every single calculation is performed. There is no “black box” logic hidden from the scientist.\nCollaborative Sharing: You can freely share your scripts and tools with colleagues anywhere in the world.\nContinuous Improvement: Anyone can fix a bug or add a new feature, which is why R has such a massive library of scientific packages.\n\n\n\nKey R Facts\n\nInterpreted: You type code, and R runs it immediately—no complex “compiling” needed.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you can correct it in your next sentence. You type a line of code in the console, hit Enter, and R gives you the answer immediately.\nC++/JAVA (Compiled) is like a Book Publisher. Imagine you are writing a novel in English that needs to be translated into French. You have to write the entire book first. You send the whole manuscript to a publisher (the “Compiler”). They translate the whole thing at once into a new, separate book. You can only “read” the results once the entire translation process is finished. If there is a typo on page 1, you might not find out until the whole book is printed. This is Compiling: It makes the final program run very fast, but it makes the writing process much slower for the person doing it.\n\nObject-Oriented: Everything in R (data, plots, models) is an “object” that you can save and reuse.\n\nImagine these objects as labeled boxes on your desk. Each “box” (object) has its own name, a specific type of content (its class), and a specific size. You can save these boxes individually or pack them all up together to use later.\n\nCase Sensitive: my_data and My_Data are seen as two different things.\n\nTips: Some R users prefer using all lowercase and underscores (e.g., blood_pressure) to avoid simple typing errors.\n\n1-Based Indexing: Unlike Python (which starts at 0), R starts counting at 1. This is much more intuitive for most researchers!\n\nJust like in Excel, your rows start at 1, 2, 3… and your columns start at A, B, C (1, 2, 3…).\nIn contrast, languages like Python start counting at 0, which can be confusing if you aren’t a software engineer!\n\nNo Spaces in Variable Names: R cannot “read” a space inside a name because it thinks the space means the command has ended.\n\nThe Rule: If you try to name a dataset Patient Data, R will look for an object called Patient and then get confused by the word Data.\nThe Solution: Most researchers use underscores (patient_data) or CamelCase (PatientData) to connect words.\n\nAllows User-Defined Functions: Beyond the built-in tools, R allows you to build your own “custom machines” to perform repetitive tasks.\n\nHow it works: If you find yourself doing the same three steps to clean your data every single morning, you can write a Function that bundles those steps into one single command. It’s like creating your own custom button in a software program that does exactly what you need.\n\nWorks with Environments: Think of an “Environment” as your Active Workspace or your digital desk.\n\nThe Concept: When you import a file or create a variable, it lives in your “Global Environment.” In RStudio, you can actually see this list in the top-right pane.\nAnalogy: If your “Objects” are the labeled boxes, the “Environment” is the room where those boxes are stored. R can handle multiple “rooms” at once, which helps keep your variables from getting mixed up when you’re running complex analyses or using different packages.",

    "text": "3. What Can R Do?\nR is a “Swiss Army Knife” for researchers.\nIt excels at:\n\nData Cleaning: Tidying messy “real-world” data into a usable format.\n\nBig Data Handling: Have you ever tried to open a BioBank dataset with thousands of patients, hundreds of clinical variables, and tens of thousands of gene expression data points?\nSpeed: While these 100MB+ (or even multi-GB) files can crash Excel, R is designed to process them efficiently. What takes minutes of “loading” in a spreadsheet takes only seconds in R.\n\nStatistics & Machine Learning: From simple T-tests to complex predictive modeling, R provides a rigorous environment for:\n\nClassical statistical testing.\n\nPerform the standard t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests you need to show your PI those all-important p-values and significant differences.\n\nLinear and non-linear modeling.\nMachine learning algorithms for predicting disease outcomes or drug responses.\nBayesian & Advanced Statistics: R is the “home” of modern statistics. If you want to use Bayesian models or other “fancy” statistical methods to handle uncertainty in your research, R has the most robust tools available.\n\nBioinformatics: Thousands of specialized tools (via Bioconductor) for DNA/RNA/Protein analysis.\n\nGenomics: DNA and RNA sequencing analysis (e.g., DESeq2).\nProteomics: Analyzing protein expression and interaction.\nSingle-Cell Analysis: Processing complex cellular data (e.g., Seurat).\n\nVisualization: Creating publication-quality plots that are far more beautiful than Excel’s defaults.\n\nOne of R’s greatest strengths is ggplot2. You can create figures that are not only “GraphPad Prism level” but often far superior in terms of customization and complexity.\nRepeatability: Once you design a beautiful plot, you can apply that same style to 100 different datasets with one click.\nProfessionalism: Most high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell) feature plots created directly in R.\nHere are a few of my visualization examples made entirely in R.\n\nCommunication: R isn’t just for math; it’s for sharing your work. You can build:\n\nInteractive Web Apps: Using R Shiny.\n\nExample: Bayesian Diagnostic Test Accuracy Meta-Analysis\nExample: shinyDeepDR: Deep Learning Prediction of Cancer Drug Response.\n\nReproducible Documents: Writing your entire Master’s thesis or Research Day posters or eBooks using Quarto (like this website!).",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nR and RStudio are two different programs that work together. R is the programming language and RStudio is a front end program that lets you write R code, view plots, etc.\nTo understand the difference, think of the relationship between a car’s engine and its dashboard:\n\nR is the Engine: It is the powerful machine under the hood. It does all the heavy lifting, makes the car move, and handles the energy. But on its own, an engine is just a block of metal on the floor—you can’t sit in it or steer it easily.\nRStudio is the Dashboard: It’s the steering wheel, the seats, the GPS, and the speedometer. It’s the beautiful interface that lets you interact with the engine so you can actually drive where you want to go.\n\nKey Takeaway: Each program must be downloaded separately. You need to install both programs on your computer, but you will only ever “open” RStudio to do your work.",
