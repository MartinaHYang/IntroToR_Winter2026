    "text": "1. R vs. RStudio: The Engine and the Dashboard\nIt is common to get these confused, but they are separate entities:\n\nR (The Engine): The programming language that does the actual math. It was developed at the University of Auckland.\n\nIt is the powerful machine under the hood. It does all the heavy lifting, makes the car move, and handles the energy. But on its own, an engine is just a block of metal on the floor—you can’t sit in it or steer it easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio (The Dashboard): An Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is the software interface (developed by Posit) that makes writing R code much easier.\n\nIt’s the steering wheel, the seats, the GPS, and the speedometer. It’s the beautiful interface that lets you interact with the engine so you can actually drive where you want to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: Each program must be downloaded separately. You need to install both programs on your computer, but you will only ever “open” RStudio to do your work.",

    "text": "2. File Types: Scripts vs. Notebooks\nIn R, there are several ways to save your work. Choosing the right file type depends on whether you are writing code for a “computer” to run or a “human” to read.\n\n2.1 R Scripts (.R)\nThink of an R Script like a plain text file for code.\n\nBest for: Automation, data cleaning pipelines, and long-term “heavy lifting.”\nPros: Very fast and lightweight. It is the “gold standard” for portability because it doesn’t require any special software other than R itself to run.\nCons: Not great for storytelling; you can add comments (using #), but you can’t include formatted text, headers, or images easily.\n\n\n\n2.2 Notebooks (.Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb)\nNotebooks follow the “Literate Programming” philosophy, where your code, its output (plots/tables), and your narrative text live together in one document.\n\nR Markdown (.Rmd): The classic notebook for R. It has been the industry standard for years for creating PDFs and Word reports.\nQuarto (.qmd): The modern “successor” to R Markdown. It is more powerful and supports multiple languages (R, Python, Julia). This entire website was built using Quarto!\nJupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Most common in the Python community, but can be used for R. Great for interactive data exploration but harder to use for writing a full thesis or book.\n\n\n\n2.3 Comparison at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Type\nExtension\nPrimary Use Case\nBest Analogy\n\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nPure code. Building tools and automating data cleaning.\nA Recipe Card: Just the instructions.\n\n\nNotebook\n.qmd / .Rmd\nWriting reports, theses, or sharing results with a PI.\nA Lab Notebook: The instructions + the results + your thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Which one should I use?\n\nIf you are writing a script that will run on a server overnight to process Biobank data: Use an R Script (.R).\nIf you are analyzing your results and want to show your PI a GTT curve along with your interpretation: Use Quarto (.qmd) or R Markdown (.Rmd).",

    "text": "3. How to interact with RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWelcome to your new workspace!\nIs this your first time opening RStudio? The interface can feel overwhelming at first with its four different panes. Don’t worry—each one has a specific purpose designed to keep your research organized.\n\n\n\n3.1 Overview\nAs shown in the figure below, the RStudio interface is divided into four primary panes. By default, they are arranged and named as follows:\n\nSource Editor (Top-Left): Where you write and save your code.\nConsole (Bottom-Left): Where R executes your commands and shows immediate results.\nEnvironment & History (Top-Right): Where your active data and past commands are stored.\nFiles, Plots, & Help (Bottom-Right): Your utility pane for navigating files, viewing graphs, and reading documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat to do if a pane is missing\n\n\n\nIf your screen doesn’t look like the default layout, or if one of the panes has disappeared:\n\nGo to the top menu and select View &gt; Panes &gt; Show All Panes.\nYou can further customize the layout and appearance under this same menu to suit your personal preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe “Disappearing” Source Pane\n\n\n\nA common question from beginners is: “Why do I only see three windows?” If the Source Editor (the top-left window) is missing, it is usually because you haven’t opened a file yet. To make it appear, you simply need to create a new script:\n\nVia Menu: Select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nVia Keyboard Shortcut:\n\nPC: Ctrl + Shift + N\nMac: Cmd + Shift + N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 The Source Editor (Top-Left)\nThis is your primary workspace. Think of it as a specialized “Text Editor” for your research files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Function Overview\nYou use this pane to write, edit, and save your scripts. Unlike the Console, everything you type here can be saved for future use.\n\n\n3.2.2 Compatibility\nRStudio can open almost any text-based file, including:\n\nData Scripts: R (.R), Python (.py), or SQL.\nNotebooks: Quarto (.qmd) and R Markdown (.Rmd).\nDocuments: Plain text (.txt), LaTeX (.tex), and BibTeX (.bib).\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Data Viewer\nYou can also use this pane to inspect datasets in a “read-only” spreadsheet format (similar to Excel).\n\n\n3.2.4 Executing Code\nTo run code from the Source Editor, you don’t just hit “Enter.” Instead, you use a specific keyboard shortcut to “send” the code from your script down to the Console:\n\nMac: Cmd + Return (or Enter)\nWindows/Linux: Ctrl + Enter\nNote: If you hit Enter by itself in the Source Editor, it will simply create a new line—just like in a Word document. It will not run your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWays to Run Your Code\n\n\n\n\nRun a Single Line: Place your cursor anywhere on the line you want to execute and use the shortcut.\nRun a Section: Highlight a block of code with your mouse and then use the shortcut to run the entire selection at once.\nThe “Run” Button: You can also highlight your code and click the Run button in the top-right corner of the Source Pane. However, most professional R users prefer the keyboard shortcuts as they are much faster and more efficient!\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Limitation\nYou cannot open Microsoft Office documents (.docx, .xlsx) or image files directly here—those must be imported using code.\n\n\n\n3.3 The Console (Bottom-Left)\nThe Console is the “Engine Room.” This is where R actually executes your commands and displays the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting Code: You can type code directly into the Console and hit Enter/Return to see the result immediately.\n\nThe Drawback: You cannot easily edit a command once it has been run. While you can use the Up Arrow key to retrieve your previous lines, these commands are not saved to your file.\nBest Practice: Always write your code in a Script (Source Pane) first, then “send” it to the Console to run. This ensures your work is reproducible.\nIt is worth emphasizing again: Code typed directly into the Console is not saved. If you want to keep your work, always write your code in the Source Editor and “send” it to the Console to run.\nHow to rescue “lost” code: If you accidentally ran a long line of code in the Console and realized you forgot to save it to your script, don’t worry! You can find it in the History tab (Top-Right pane).\n\nThe History tab shows every command you have executed in order.\nIt does not show the results or outputs (like plots or tables), only the text of the commands.\nYou can select a line in the History tab and click “To Source” to send it back to your permanent script.\n\n\nThe Broom Icon: Use the broom icon (top-right of the pane) or the shortcut Ctrl + L to clear the text if the window becomes cluttered. This does not delete your data; it just cleans your screen.\n\nNote: This only clears the “text” on the screen; it does not delete your data or variables.\n\nChecking Your R Version: The top of the Console displays your current R version (e.g., R 4.4.1). If a package fails to install, check here first to see if you need to update R.\n\nNote that updating RStudio (the software) does not automatically update R (the language engine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding Your Working Directory: Right next to your R version, you will see a file path starting with ~/. This is your Working Directory—the specific folder on your computer where R is currently “looking” for files.\n\nUnderstanding how R finds files is essential to avoiding the common \"File not found\" error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\nAbsolute Path\nThe full “GPS address” from your C: drive or User folder.\nC:/Users/Martina/Project/data/raw_counts.csv\n\n\nRelative Path\nA “shorthand” address starting from your current folder.\nIn that case, your Working Directory must be set to: C:/Users/Martina/Project/\ndata/raw_counts.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBest Practice: We recommend putting your relative data and your R script in the same folder (or a sub-folder) and using Relative Paths. This makes your project “portable”—if you send the whole folder to a colleague, the code will still work on their computer!\n\n\n\n\n3.4 The Environment & History (Top-Right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment: This tab shows you every “object” (datasets, variables, results) currently stored in R’s memory. If a variable isn’t listed here, R doesn’t know it exists!\n\nThe “Golden Rule”: If a variable or dataset isn’t listed here, R does not know it exists! If you get an error saying Object not found, check this tab first to see if you successfully created or imported it.\n\nHistory: This tracks every single line of code you have run in the current session. If you forgot to save a line of code to your script, you can find it here.\nKey Features & Icons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave/Load Workspace (Disk Icons): These allow you to save your entire Environment as an .RData file. This is a huge time-saver for large projects; instead of re-running hours of code to recreate your variables, you can simply “Load” the .RData file and pick up exactly where you left off.\nImport Dataset Button: This is a “user-friendly” wizard that helps you import Excel, CSV, or SPSS files without typing out the code yourself. It’s a great “shortcut” for beginners—RStudio will even show you the code it generated so you can learn for next time.\nMemory Usage (Pie Chart): This shows how much of your computer’s RAM is being used by R. If this number is extremely high, your computer may slow down or “lag.” This is common when working with massive genomic datasets or the UK Biobank.\nThe Broom Icon (Clear Environment): Clicking the broom will delete everything in your current Environment. Use this with caution! It is useful for a “fresh start,” but it cannot be undone.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Files, Plots, & Help (Bottom-Right)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your “Utility” pane:\n\nFiles: A basic file explorer to navigate your computer.\nPlots: Where your visualizations (like GTT curves) will appear once you run your code.\nHelp: The most useful tab for beginners!\n\nThe Search Bar: You can type the name of any function (e.g., ggplot) or package (e.g., dplyr) directly into the search bar at the top of the Help pane.\nThe Console Shortcut: A faster way used by most R users is to type a question mark ? followed by the function name in the Console and hit Enter:\n\n?mean   # This opens the help page for the mean function\n?sd     # This opens the help page for standard deviation\n\nWhat to look for: R documentation can be dense, but you should always scroll to the very bottom to find the Examples section. You can copy and paste these examples directly into your console to see how the function works in action.",

    "text": "2. Assignment: Creating Objects\nAssignment is the process of storing a value (data) inside a named container (an object).\n\n2.1 The Left-Hand Assignment (&lt;-)\nThe standard way to assign values in R is using the &lt;- operator. Think of it as an arrow pointing from the data to the label.\n\n# The convention is to use left hand assignation \nvar1 &lt;- \"hello world\"\nvar1\n\n[1] \"hello world\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteShortcut for &lt;-\n\n\n\nInstead of typing two characters, use these shortcuts to insert the assignment arrow:\n\nMac: Option + - (minus key)\nWindows: Alt + - (minus key)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteA Note on Coding Style: To Space or Not to Space?\n\n\n\nWhile var1&lt;-“hello world” works, it is a little bit “dirty” and hard to read.\nFollowing the Tidyverse Style Guide, you should always put a space before and after the assignment operator: var1 &lt;- \"hello world\"\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Other Assignment Methods\n\n2.2.1 The Equals Sign (=):\nWhile = works for assignment, R users generally avoid it. In R, = is typically reserved for defining arguments inside a function. Using it for general assignment is considered poor style.\n\n# It is also possible to use the '=' sign, but is NOT a good practice\nvar1 = \"hello world\"\nvar1\n\n[1] \"hello world\"\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Right-Hand Assignment (-&gt;):\nYou can technically point the arrow the other way: \"data\" -&gt; var1.\nThis is rarely used but can be helpful at the end of a long pipe (|&gt;) if you decide to save the final result into a new variable.\n\n\"hello world\" -&gt; var1\nvar1\n\n[1] \"hello world\"\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Printing Variables\nOnce you have stored data in a variable, there are several ways to “call” it back to the console:\n\n2.3.1 Direct Call\nSimply type the name. This is the most common method during interactive analysis.\n\n\"hello world!\"\n\n[1] \"hello world!\"\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Using Function print() and cat()\nprint(): Explicitly prints the object. This is often used inside “loops” or complex functions where R might not automatically show the output.\ncat(): Short for “concatenate.” It prints the raw text without the [1] index marker or quotes. It is great for creating clean, human-readable messages.\n\nvar1 &lt;- \"McGill\"\nprint(var1)\n\n[1] \"McGill\"\n\n\n\nvar1 &lt;- \"McGill\"\ncat(var1)\n\nMcGill",

    "text": "1. Character\nThe Character class represents text data. This can be a single letter, a word, or an entire sentence. In R, anything wrapped in quotation marks is treated as text.\n\nclass(\"a\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUnderstanding the class() Function\n\n\n\nFunctions: In R, a function typically follows the format function_name().\nArguments: The information you put inside the parentheses () is called an argument. The function takes that argument, processes it, and returns a result.\nTesting Types: The class() function is your go-to tool for identifying the data type of any object or value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEfficiency Tip: The Quotation Shortcut\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, you don’t have to manually type quotation marks at the beginning and end of every word or sentence. There is a “surround” shortcut that handles this for you:\n\nHighlight the word, number, or sentence you want to wrap in quotes.\nPress the Quote Key:\n\nOn both Mac and Windows, simply hit the \" (Shift + ') or ' key.\n\nResult: RStudio will automatically place a quotation mark at the start and the end of your selection.\n\n\nWait, where else does this work?\nThis shortcut also works for other “pairing” symbols in RStudio:\n\nParentheses: Highlight text and press ( to get (text).\nBrackets: Highlight text and press [ to get [text].\nBraces: Highlight text and press { to get {text}.\n\nNote: This is a specific feature of the RStudio IDE. While it works in some modern code editors (like VS Code), it generally will not work in standard software like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Working with Strings and Sentences\nR can handle strings of any length, from a single word to a full paragraph.\n\nclass(\"Hello World!\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nYou can even store long blocks of text, such as this land acknowledgement:\n\nclass(\"McGill University is on land which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst Indigenous peoples, including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations. We acknowledge and thank the diverse Indigenous peoples whose presence marks this territory on which peoples of the world now gather.\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSingle vs. Double Quotes\n\n\n\nIn R, there is no functional difference between using double quotes (” “) and single quotes (’ ’). However, double quotes are the standard convention in the R community.\nThe Rule for “Nesting” Quotes: If your text contains a quote, you must use the other type of quotation mark on the outside so R knows where the string starts and ends.\n\n\n\n# If the text has single quotes, use double quotes outside\nclass(\"It's a beautiful day in Montreal.\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# If the text has double quotes, use single quotes outside\nclass('We said, \"R is powerful.\"')\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Numbers as Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that if you wrap a number in quotes, R will treat it as text, not as a mathematical value.\nYou cannot perform math (like addition) on a character “1”.\n\n\n\nclass(\"1\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Common Error: Variables vs. Literal Text\nOne of the most frequent mistakes for beginners is forgetting the quotation marks. This is where the difference between a Value and a Variable becomes critical.\nIf you try to check the class of a without quotes, you will encounter an error:\n\nclass(a)\n\nError:\n! object 'a' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy did this fail?\n\n\n\nWithout the quotation marks, R doesn’t see the letter “a”. Instead, it looks for an object or variable named a on your workbench (Environment). Since we haven’t created a variable named a yet, R reports: Error: object ‘a’ not found.",

You cannot perform math on this; to R, this is no different than the word “Apple.”\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 How Numbers are Stored: “Doubles”\nWhy does R call a whole number “Numeric” instead of an “Integer”?\nBy default, R uses Double-precision floating-point format (often called “Doubles”) to store numbers.\n\nPrecision: Each “Double” is stored using 8 bytes of memory and is accurate up to approximately 16 significant decimal digits.\nFlexibility: Storing numbers with decimals by default allows R to handle complex division and scientific calculations without losing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteForcing an Integer\n\n\n\nIf you specifically need a whole number to be stored as an Integer (which uses less memory), you must add an L after the number: class(1L) will return \"integer\".\nHowever, for 99% of medical research tasks, the default Numeric setting is exactly what you need.",

For reproducible research, stick to the full words!\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Case Sensitivity and Common Errors\nR is strictly case-sensitive. The logical values must be in all caps.\nIf you use “Sentence case” (e.g., True), R will assume you are looking for a variable with that name and throw an error.\n\nclass(True)\n\nError:\n! object 'True' not found\n\nclass(False)\n\nError:\n! object 'False' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSummary\n\n\n\nThere are only two ways to correctly define a logical data type:\n\nTRUE / FALSE (Full words, all upper case).\nT / F (Single letters, upper case).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Application: Filtering Data\nIn bioinformatics, you will use logicals constantly to filter your data. For example:\ngene_expression &gt; 10 returns a list of TRUE/FALSE values.\nYou can then use that list to keep only the genes where the result was TRUE.",

    "text": "6. Missing Value\nIn R, missing data is represented by the logical constant NA (Not Available). It acts as a placeholder to indicate that a data entry is simply not there.\nUseful for manipulating data sets where missing entries are common.\n\nNA\n\n[1] NA\n\nclass(NA)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy use NA instead of 0?\n\n\n\nIt is a common mistake in research to fill missing entries with 0. However, in a medical context, zero is a value (e.g., zero glucose, zero heart rate), whereas NA is an absence of data (e.g., the patient missed their appointment). Treating an NA as a 0 will incorrectly skew your averages and invalidate your statistical tests.\n\n\n\n6.1 How is this helpful for your research?\n\nAutomated Data Handling\n\nWhen you import an Excel sheet into R, empty cells are automatically converted to NA. Most R functions are designed to handle these gracefully. For example, when calculating the average weight of a group, you can tell R to ignore the missing entries: mean(weights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nEfficient Quality Control (QC)\n\nInstead of scanning a spreadsheet with thousands of rows by eye, you can use R to:\n\nCount exactly how many entries are missing in a clinical trial.\nIdentify which patients have incomplete gene expression profiles.\nFilter your dataset to remove any rows or columns that contain NA values in just one line of code (e.g., na.omit()).\n\n\nTransparency and Reproducibility\n\nUsing NA keeps your data “honest.” It is a professional standard to keep notes on why data is missing (e.g., “sample contaminated” or “patient withdrew”). By keeping NA in your raw data and handling it with code, you create a clear, reproducible trail of how you arrived at your final results.",

    "text": "1. Why Not Excel?\nExcel is a fantastic tool for initial data entry and simple calculations. However, for professional scientific research, it has significant limitations that can compromise your results.\n\nThe Limitations of Spreadsheets\n\nInflexible with Large Data: Large datasets (like genomic data) often cause Excel to lag or crash. Searching a 100MB spreadsheet can take minutes in Excel.\n\nIn R, the same search takes milliseconds. R is designed to handle millions of rows efficiently and uses optimized data compression to keep your workflow fast.\n\nAutomatic “Auto-Correct” Errors: Excel is famous for “helpfully” converting gene names like MARCH1 into dates (e.g., 01-March-2025). This has historically corrupted thousands of published papers.\n\nIn R, your data is treated as pure text by default. R won’t change your data unless you explicitly tell it to.\nNote: The only common “auto-change” in R is the word NA, which R reserves for “Not Available” (missing data)—we will discuss this later.\n\nPoor Reproducibility: In Excel, if you accidentally delete a cell or change a value, there is no “audit trail.” You might never notice the mistake.\n\nIn R, every change is documented in your code. You can add comments to explain why you made a change, allowing you (and your collaborators) to follow your logic months later.\n\nVersion Incompatibility: We have all experienced an Excel file that looks perfect on a Mac but appears broken or “skewed” when opened on Windows or in different software like Numbers or WPS.\n\nR is a pure programming language, meaning your code will run exactly the same way regardless of the operating system.\n\nThe “Copy-Paste” Risk: Many students store data in Excel but copy-paste it into software like GraphPad Prism or SPSS for analysis. This manual step is a major source of human error. It’s easy to lose track of which version of the data you copied.\n\nIn R, you import your data directly via code. This creates a clear, permanent link between your raw data and your final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMy Personal Recommendation\n\n\n\nExcel remains the most user-friendly interface for manual data entry and “beautifying” simple tables for quick viewing.\nI personally recommend a hybrid workflow:\n\nUse Excel (specifically saving as .csv files rather than .xlsx, just my personal preference) for initial data storage.\nUse R for all subsequent data cleaning, statistical analysis, and publication-quality visualization.",

    "section": "2. What is R?",
    "text": "2. What is R?\nR is more than just a tool; it is a Statistical Programming Language designed by scientists, for scientists. It is an integrated suite for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical display.\n\nThe “Free” in Free Software\nIn the world of coding, we often say R is “Free as in Speech, not just free as in beer.” This means it isn’t just about the cost ($0); it is about the freedom to use and share it.\nThis philosophy gives you four fundamental freedoms:\n\nUnlimited Use: You can run the program for any purpose (academic, commercial, or personal) without expensive licenses.\nFull Transparency: You can study how every single calculation is performed. There is no “black box” logic hidden from the scientist.\nCollaborative Sharing: You can freely share your scripts and tools with colleagues anywhere in the world.\nContinuous Improvement: Anyone can fix a bug or add a new feature, which is why R has such a massive library of scientific packages.\n\n\n\nKey R Facts\n\nInterpreted: You type code, and R runs it immediately—no complex “compiling” needed.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you can correct it in your next sentence. You type a line of code in the console, hit Enter, and R gives you the answer immediately.\nC++/JAVA (Compiled) is like a Book Publisher. Imagine you are writing a novel in English that needs to be translated into French. You have to write the entire book first. You send the whole manuscript to a publisher (the “Compiler”). They translate the whole thing at once into a new, separate book. You can only “read” the results once the entire translation process is finished. If there is a typo on page 1, you might not find out until the whole book is printed. This is Compiling: It makes the final program run very fast, but it makes the writing process much slower for the person doing it.\n\nObject-Oriented: Everything in R (data, plots, models) is an “object” that you can save and reuse.\n\nImagine these objects as labeled boxes on your desk. Each “box” (object) has its own name, a specific type of content (its class), and a specific size. You can save these boxes individually or pack them all up together to use later.\n\nCase Sensitive: my_data and My_Data are seen as two different things.\n\nTips: Some R users prefer using all lowercase and underscores (e.g., blood_pressure) to avoid simple typing errors.\n\n1-Based Indexing: Unlike Python (which starts at 0), R starts counting at 1. This is much more intuitive for most researchers!\n\nJust like in Excel, your rows start at 1, 2, 3… and your columns start at A, B, C (1, 2, 3…).\nIn contrast, languages like Python start counting at 0, which can be confusing if you aren’t a software engineer!\n\nNo Spaces in Variable Names: R cannot “read” a space inside a name because it thinks the space means the command has ended.\n\nThe Rule: If you try to name a dataset Patient Data, R will look for an object called Patient and then get confused by the word Data.\nThe Solution: Most researchers use underscores (patient_data) or CamelCase (PatientData) to connect words.\n\nAllows User-Defined Functions: Beyond the built-in tools, R allows you to build your own “custom machines” to perform repetitive tasks.\n\nHow it works: If you find yourself doing the same three steps to clean your data every single morning, you can write a Function that bundles those steps into one single command. It’s like creating your own custom button in a software program that does exactly what you need.\n\nWorks with Environments: Think of an “Environment” as your Active Workspace or your digital desk.\n\nThe Concept: When you import a file or create a variable, it lives in your “Global Environment.” In RStudio, you can actually see this list in the top-right pane.\nAnalogy: If your “Objects” are the labeled boxes, the “Environment” is the room where those boxes are stored. R can handle multiple “rooms” at once, which helps keep your variables from getting mixed up when you’re running complex analyses or using different packages.",

    "text": "3. What Can R Do?\nR is a “Swiss Army Knife” for researchers.\nIt excels at:\n\nData Cleaning: Tidying messy “real-world” data into a usable format.\n\nBig Data Handling: Have you ever tried to open a BioBank dataset with thousands of patients, hundreds of clinical variables, and tens of thousands of gene expression data points?\nSpeed: While these 100MB+ (or even multi-GB) files can crash Excel, R is designed to process them efficiently. What takes minutes of “loading” in a spreadsheet takes only seconds in R.\n\nStatistics & Machine Learning: From simple T-tests to complex predictive modeling, R provides a rigorous environment for:\n\nClassical statistical testing.\n\nPerform the standard t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests you need to show your PI those all-important p-values and significant differences.\n\nLinear and non-linear modeling.\nMachine learning algorithms for predicting disease outcomes or drug responses.\nBayesian & Advanced Statistics: R is the “home” of modern statistics. If you want to use Bayesian models or other “fancy” statistical methods to handle uncertainty in your research, R has the most robust tools available.\n\nBioinformatics: Thousands of specialized tools (via Bioconductor) for DNA/RNA/Protein analysis.\n\nGenomics: DNA and RNA sequencing analysis (e.g., DESeq2).\nProteomics: Analyzing protein expression and interaction.\nSingle-Cell Analysis: Processing complex cellular data (e.g., Seurat).\n\nVisualization: Creating publication-quality plots that are far more beautiful than Excel’s defaults.\n\nOne of R’s greatest strengths is ggplot2. You can create figures that are not only “GraphPad Prism level” but often far superior in terms of customization and complexity.\nRepeatability: Once you design a beautiful plot, you can apply that same style to 100 different datasets with one click.\nProfessionalism: Most high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell) feature plots created directly in R.\nHere are a few of my visualization examples made entirely in R.\n\nCommunication: R isn’t just for math; it’s for sharing your work. You can build:\n\nInteractive Web Apps: Using R Shiny.\n\nExample: Bayesian Diagnostic Test Accuracy Meta-Analysis\nExample: shinyDeepDR: Deep Learning Prediction of Cancer Drug Response.\n\nReproducible Documents: Writing your entire Master’s thesis or Research Day posters or eBooks using Quarto (like this website!).",

Vector\nKey points:\n\nThe fundamental building block of R.\nCan only contain objects of the same class (e.g., all numeric or all character).\nEven a single number in R is actually a vector of length 1.\n\n\n\n2.1 Numeric Vectors\nThere are multiple ways to create numeric vectors.\n\n2.1.1 Method A: c() (Combine)\nThis is the most common method.\n\nx &lt;- c(0.3, 0.1)\nx\n\n[1] 0.3 0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCoding Style:\nThe Comma Rule It is not mandatory to put a space after a comma—both c(0.3, 0.1) and c(0.3,0.1) will work perfectly.\nHowever, much like writing in English, your code is significantly easier for others (and your future self) to read if you consistently place a space after every comma. It makes your code look professional and clean.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Method B: vector() or numeric()\nCreates an empty vector of a specific size (defaults to 0).\n\nx &lt;- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = 10)\nx\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\nx &lt;- numeric(length = 10)\nx\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Method C: seq() and rep()\nSequences (seq and rep) Useful for generating data automatically.\n\n# Sequence from 1 to 10, jumping by 2\nx &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)\nx\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n# Repeat the number 2, 10 times\nx &lt;- rep(2, 10)\nx\n\n [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nChecking Vector Length with length()\n\n## Creates an empty vector of length 10\nx &lt;- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = 10)\nx\n##  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nlength(x)\n## [1] 10\n\n# Repeat the number 2, 5 times\ny &lt;- rep(2, 5)\ny\n## [1] 2 2 2 2 2\nlength(y)\n## [1] 5\n\nlength(x) == length(y)\n## [1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Integer Vectors\nIntegers are whole numbers.

You cannot have a single vector that is half-numbers and half-text.\n\nWhat happens in paste()?\n\nWhen you run paste(\"Patient\", 1:5, sep = \"_\"):\n\n“Patient” is a Character vector.\n1:5 is an Integer/Numeric vector (1, 2, 3…).\nSince you can’t join “text” and “numbers” into a single result without them being the same type, R implicitly (automatically) converts the numbers into text strings (“1”, “2”, “3”).\n\n\nWhy is this important?\n\n\nIn R, there is a “Hierarchy of Types.” If you mix different types in a vector, R will always coerce them to the “least restrictive” type to ensure no data is lost, following this order:\n\nLogical → Integer → Numeric → Character\n\nExample of unexpected coercion:\nIf you accidentally include a single piece of text in your column of gene expression numbers, R will turn the entire column into text.\n\n\n# Mixing numbers and one \"missing\" string\ndata &lt;- c(1.2, 3.5, \"missing\", 4.8)\n\n# Check the class\nclass(data)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nBecause of coercion, you can no longer calculate the mean() or sum() of that data because R now sees them all as “character” rather than “numbers.” This is a very common reason why R scripts fail during data cleaning!\n\n\n# Mixing numbers and one \"missing\" string\ndata &lt;- c(1.2, 3.5, \"missing\", 4.8)\n\nmean(data)\n\nWarning in mean.default(data): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Vector Attributes (Names)\nYou can give names to specific elements in a vector. This is great for readability.\n\nx &lt;- 1:5\nnames(x) &lt;- c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\")\nx\n\n  one   two three  four  five \n    1     2     3     4     5 \n\nx &lt;- logical(length = 4)\nnames(x) &lt;- c(\"F1\", \"F2\", \"F3\", \"F4\")\nx\n\n   F1    F2    F3    F4 \nFALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \n\n\n\n\n2.6 Vector indexing\nIn R, indices are 1-based, meaning the first item is at position 1. For these examples, we will use a vector of 15 random numbers.\n\n# We set a seed so everyone in the workshop gets the same 15 numbers\nset.seed(228)\n\n# Create 15 unique random numbers between 1 and 100\nx &lt;- sample(x = 1:100, size = 15, replace = FALSE)\nx\n\n [1] 84 61 52 40 62 88 49 65 28 18 75 46 83 23 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipReproducible Randomness: set.seed()\n\n\n\nThe sample() function generates random numbers. Ordinarily, every time you run it, you get a different result. However, in scientific research, we need our results to be reproducible.\nThe set.seed() function provides a “secret key” (the seed) to the random number generator. As long as two people use the same seed, they will get the exact same “random” numbers every time. The seed can be any number you like—important date, your favorite number, or even a random string of digits.\nFun facts: the number 42 is one of the most popular seeds in the world, appearing in roughly 4% of all public code. This is a nod to Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.”\n\n\n\n2.6.1 Using Position (Numeric Indexing)\nYou can grab a single item or a range of items using square brackets [].\n\nx[1]   # Get the first element\n## [1] 84\nx[13]  # Get the thirteenth element\n## [1] 83\n\n# Get the first 12 numbers using a sequence\nx[1:12] \n##  [1] 84 61 52 40 62 88 49 65 28 18 75 46\n\n# Get specific positions using a vector of indices\nx[c(1, 5, 9)]\n## [1] 84 62 28\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Using Names\nIf your vector has names assigned to its elements, you can use those names (as strings) to pull data. This is much safer than numeric indexing because the name stays with the data even if the order changes.\n\n# Assign letters a-o as names to our 15 numbers\nnames(x) &lt;- letters[1:length(x)]\n\n# Access specific elements by name\nx[c(\"a\", \"c\", \"d\")]\n\n a  c  d \n84 52 40 \n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Using Logical Filters (The “Question” Method)\nThis is the most powerful way to index. Instead of giving a position, you give R a Logical Vector (TRUE/FALSE). R will only return the items that are TRUE.\n\n# Which numbers are greater than 50?\nx[x &gt; 50] \n##  a  b  c  e  f  h  k  m \n## 84 61 52 62 88 65 75 83\n\n# Only return numbers that are less than or equal to 30\nx[x &lt;= 30]\n##  i  j  n  o \n## 28 18 23 16\n\n# Only return even numbers (using the Modulus operator %%)\nx[x %% 2 == 0]\n##  a  c  d  e  f  i  j  l  o \n## 84 52 40 62 88 28 18 46 16\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Skipping Elements\nSometimes you want everything except a few specific items. In R, you do this by using a negative sign - or the Not Equal != operator.\nUsing Negative Indices:\n\n# Return the vector EXCEPT the 1st and 5th elements\nx[c(-1, -5)]\n\n b  c  d  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o \n61 52 40 88 49 65 28 18 75 46 83 23 16 \n\n\nUsing Names:\n\n# Return everything EXCEPT the element named \"a\"\nx[names(x) != \"a\"]\n\n b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o \n61 52 40 62 88 49 65 28 18 75 46 83 23 16",

    "text": "7. Data Frame\nKey points:\n\nThe most common data structure for researchers.\n2-Dimensional (like a matrix).\nCan mix data types (e.g., Column 1 is Numeric, Column 2 is Character).\n\nColumns in data frames are vectors\nA data frame is essentially a list of vectors\n\nThink of it like an Excel Spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe Three Rules of Data Frame Anatomy\n\n\n\n\n1. The Column Rule (The Vector)\nEvery column in a data frame is a Vector.\nThis means that within a single column (like Age or Gene_Expression), every single entry must be the same data type. You cannot have a number in row 1 and a word in row 2 of the same column.\n\n\n2. The Row Rule (The List)\nThe data frame itself is a List where each element of the list is one of those columns.\nBecause a list can hold different types of objects, your first list element (Column 1) can be “Numeric” and your second list element (Column 2) can be “Character.”\n\n\n3. The Alignment Rule (The “Rectangle”)\nThis is the only way a Data Frame differs from a standard List:\n\nIn a List, you can have one vector of length 10 and another vector of length 500.\nIn a Data Frame, R forces a “Rectangular” constraint. Every column (vector) must have the exact same length.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Data Frame:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(\"P001\", \"P002\", \"P003\"),\n  Age = c(25, 34, 28),\n  Treatment = c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug\", \"Placebo\")\n)\ndf\n\n    ID Age Treatment\n1 P001  25   Placebo\n2 P002  34      Drug\n3 P003  28   Placebo\n\n\n\n7.1 Confirming Data Frame Structure and Size\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(\"P001\", \"P002\", \"P003\"),\n  Age = c(25, 34, 28),\n  Treatment = c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug\", \"Placebo\")\n)\n\nclass(df)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\ntypeof(df)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(df)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ ID       : chr  \"P001\" \"P002\" \"P003\"\n $ Age      : num  25 34 28\n $ Treatment: chr  \"Placebo\" \"Drug\" \"Placebo\"\n\nhead(df)\n\n    ID Age Treatment\n1 P001  25   Placebo\n2 P002  34      Drug\n3 P003  28   Placebo\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Re-naming columns\nYou can rename a specific column by targeting its index (its position number).\n\n# Let's rename the 3nd column to \"Group\"\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(\"P001\", \"P002\", \"P003\"),\n  Age = c(25, 34, 28),\n  Treatment = c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug\", \"Placebo\")\n)\n\ncolnames(df)[3] &lt;- \"Group\"\n\n# Check the change\nhead(df)\n\n    ID Age   Group\n1 P001  25 Placebo\n2 P002  34    Drug\n3 P003  28 Placebo\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Indexing and sub-setting\nThere are three main ways to pull data out of a data frame. Think of this as giving R an “address” to find your data.\n\nMethod A: The Dollar Sign ($)\nThe most common way to grab a single column by its name. This returns a vector.\n\ndf$ID\n\n[1] \"P001\" \"P002\" \"P003\"\n\n\n\n\nMethod B: Single Brackets with Name ([ ])\nThis returns a data frame containing only that column.\n\ndf[\"Age\"]\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  34\n3  28\n\n\n\n\nMethod C: Coordinate Indexing ([row, col])\nThis is the most precise method. You provide the Row number, then a comma, then the Column number.\n\ndf[1, ]: The 1st Row (all columns).\ndf[, 1]: The 1st Column (all rows).\ndf[3, 2]: The specific value at Row 3, Column 2.\n\n\ndf[,3]\n\n[1] \"Placebo\" \"Drug\"    \"Placebo\"\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4 Coercion\nCoercion is the act of forcing an object to change from one structure or type to another. We use the as. family of functions to do this.\n\nList to Data Frame\nThis is a very common workflow: you collect various results in a list and then “solidify” them into a rectangular data frame for plotting or saving.\n\n# 1. Create a list with two vectors of equal length\nl &lt;- list(numbers = 1:10, lowercase = letters[1:10])\n\n# 2. Check type\ntypeof(l)\n## [1] \"list\"\n\n# 3. Coerce the list into a data frame\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(l)\n\n# 4. Observe the change\ntypeof(df)\n## [1] \"list\"\nhead(df)\n##   numbers lowercase\n## 1       1         a\n## 2       2         b\n## 3       3         c\n## 4       4         d\n## 5       5         e\n## 6       6         f",

    "text": "11. Summary of Indexing and subsetting\nNavigating data in R depends on whether your object is 1-Dimensional (linear) or 2-Dimensional (rectangular). Indexing is the most frequent source of errors for beginners, so here is the master cheat sheet for finding your data.\n\n11.1 The Universal Indexing Rules\nBefore looking at specific structures, remember these three core rules of R:\n\n1-Based Indexing: The first item is always [1], not [0].\nSquare Brackets []: These are the “envelopes” used to hold your address.\nNegative Indices: Using a minus sign (e.g., [-1]) means “Give me everything except this position.”\n\n\n\n11.2 Indexing by Data Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\nDimension\nPrimary Method\nExample\nResult\n\n\n\n\nVector\n1D\n[ x ]\nv[1:3]\nReturns the first 3 elements.\n\n\nFactor\n1D\n[ x ]\nf[1]\nReturns the first element + its levels.\n\n\nList\n1D\n[[ x ]] or $\nl[[1]]\nReturns the content of the first “drawer.”\n\n\nMatrix\n2D\n[row, col]\nm[1, 2]\nValue at Row 1, Column 2.\n\n\nData Frame\n2D\n$ or [row, col]\ndf$age\nReturns the entire “age” column as a vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 Specific Methods & Nuances\n\nThe 2D Coordinate System ([row, col])\nUsed for Matrices and Data Frames. The comma is the most important part!\n\ndf[1, 5]: Specific cell (Row 1, Col 5).\ndf[1, ]: Entire Row (Leave the column space empty).\ndf[, 5]: Entire Column (Leave the row space empty).\n\n\n\nList vs. Data Frame Access\nBecause a Data Frame is technically a “list of vectors,” it is the most flexible structure for indexing.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(\"P001\", \"P002\", \"P003\"),\n  Age = c(25, 34, 28),\n  Treatment = c(\"Placebo\", \"Drug\", \"Placebo\")\n)\n\n# By Name ($) — Fast and readable\ndf$Treatment\n\n# By Position — Useful when you don't know the names but know the order\ndf[, 1]\n\n# By Logical Mask — Returns all rows where the Age is over 50\ndf[df$Age &gt; 50, ]",
