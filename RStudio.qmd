## Learning Objectives

By the end of this page, you will understand:

-   The limitations of spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) for scientific research.

-   The fundamental nature of R as an open-source statistical language.

-   The distinction between R and RStudio (the "Engine" vs. the "Dashboard").

-   How to choose between R and other languages like Python.

## R vs. RStudio: The Engine and the Dashboard

It is common to get these confused, but they are separate entities:

-   **R (The Engine):** The programming language that does the actual math. It was developed at the University of Auckland.
-   **RStudio (The Dashboard):** An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. It is the software interface (developed by **Posit**) that makes writing R code much easier.

## File Types: Scripts vs. Notebooks

In this workshop, we will encounter different ways to save R code:

| File Type | Extension | Primary Use |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **R Script** | `.R` | Pure code. Best for automation and long-term portability. |
| **R Markdown** | `.Rmd` | A mix of text and code. Great for simple reports. |
| **Quarto** | `.qmd` | The next generation of RMarkdown. Best for websites, books, and high-quality docs. |
